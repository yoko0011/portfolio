# portfolio

## Challenges 
In this portfolio, which I worked on for this final assignment, I encountered various problems initially. First, I used bootstrap for the header, but the navigation was unresponsive and positioned too high on some pages. I added new classes only for those pages that were out of alignment and made minor adjustments. I also made the layout so that the text and photos on every page were aligned vertically in two columns, so I used to row and col-lg-6 to position the text and images.

##  Learned
What I realized after creating this portfolio is the importance of the original mockup. I learned that it is easier to create according to the mockup if there is a proper mockup. I also learned that it is better not to specify every page with the same class that you are using. If you do, other pages will be out of alignment, and when you fix the other pages, the other pages will be out of alignment again, and so on. If you want to specify a specific part of a page in detail, it is important to make sure to add a different class. It is also important to use percentages instead of fine numbers to fit various screen sizes and to avoid breakage later.
